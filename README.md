# Calculate from String 
- Using two stacks, one for operatos and one for integers. 
- Calculates most values , however has difficulty calculating values for numbers that begin with (-) sign.
For example "-1 + 54" "-2-2" will give wrong answers. 
I am currently working on this problem.

PLAN FOR THE FUTURE-----------------
1. Fix the (-)sign problem.
