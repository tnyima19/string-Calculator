This program calculates number which are given in a string. It uses stacks and and priority functions to determine the priority of operations, and subtacts, multiples, adds or divides accordingly. 
One problem of this code is that is gives wrong answers if you give any string whose first characters are -ve. For example "-1 + 54" "-2-2" will give wrong answers. 
I am currently working on this problem.
